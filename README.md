Contains Lua scripts for execution in fceux

## BKoAC.lua
Has many important memory locations for mutable attributes in the game.  It also takes a parameter, `activateHero` which will allow you to be a hero if you select Scenario 1 (it will replace the first choice).

If you choose `gaoQiu` it will eventually crash.  However, I believe the other 10 good fellows (e.g. `robedScholar`) will work just fine.

It will also display Gao Qiu's current whereabouts, his troops and their skills and arms.
